My research is focused on developing statistical methods and computational tools to solve real biomedical problems. I am particularly interested in statistical methods for high-dimensional genomics data with cell-type heterogeneity, clustered structure, and missing values. My research spans:
* cell type deconvolution
* single-cell RNA sequencing data
* mixed-effects models
* machine learning methods
* proteomics data.

My collaboration is in areas such as Alzheimer's disease, psychiatry, asthma, and breast cancer. We analyze data from whole genome/exome sequencing, bulk/single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA methylation, proteomics, etc.

Our lab is currently funded by R01AG080590 and R03OD034501.
