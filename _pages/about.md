I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at the University of Pittsburgh. Before joining Pitt in January 2020, I worked as a postdoc researcher  at Carnegie Mellon University and received my PhD in Biostatistics from the University of Chicago in 2017. My research interests include statistical genomics and causal inference of omics data. My research is focused on developing statistical methods and computational tools to solve real biomedical problems. My research spans:
* single-cell/spatial omics data
* cell type deconvolution
* epigeomics data
* mediation analysis.

My collaboration is in areas such as Alzheimer's disease, psychiatry, asthma, and breast cancer. We analyze data from whole genome/exome sequencing, bulk/single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA methylation, proteomics, etc.

Our lab is currently funded by R01AG080590 (Statistical methods for population-level cell-type-specific analyses of tissue omics data for Alzheimer's disease) and R21AG087057 (Heterogeneous genetics effects and mediation in Alzheimer's disease).
