My research is focused on developing statistical methods and computational tools to solve real biomedical problems. I am interested in statistical methods for high-dimensional genomics data with cell-type heterogeneity, clustered structure, and missing values. My research spans:
* single-cell/spatial omics data
* cell type deconvolution
* proteomics data
* mediation analysis.

My collaboration is in areas such as Alzheimer's disease, psychiatry, asthma, and breast cancer. We analyze data from whole genome/exome sequencing, bulk/single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA methylation, proteomics, etc.

Our lab is currently funded by R01AG080590 (Statistical methods for population-level cell-type-specific analyses of tissue omics data for Alzheimer's disease) and R21AG087057 (Heterogeneous genetics effects and mediation in Alzheimer's disease).
