The primary goal of my research is to develop statistical methods and computational tools to solve real biomedical problems. I am particularly interested in statistical methods for high-dimensional genomics data with cell-type heterogeneity, clustered structure, and missing values. My research spans cell type deconvolution, single-cell RNA sequencing data, mixed-effects models, machine learning methods, missing data, and proteomics data.

I have collaboration experience in areas such as Alzheimer's disease, psychiatry, asthma, and breast cancer. I am familiar with data analysis pipelines for whole genome/exome sequencing, bulk/single-cell RNA sequencing, DNA methylation, proteomics, etc.
